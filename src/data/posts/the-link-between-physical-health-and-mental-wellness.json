  "html": "<p>Most people think of mental health and physical health as separate tracks. In reality, they’re two lanes on the same road—and ignoring one makes it hard to travel far on the other.</p><p>At Oasis Health Services, we see this connection every day. Poor sleep, chronic pain, or hormonal changes can make anxiety and depression worse. Likewise, untreated depression can lead to fatigue, headaches, and digestive issues that medicine alone can’t fix.</p><p>That’s why our approach blends psychiatric care, primary care, and therapy. We help patients look at the whole picture: blood work, stress levels, nutrition, lifestyle habits, and emotional wellbeing. When all those pieces work together, healing feels more natural and sustainable.</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If you’ve been treating mental or physical symptoms separately, it might be time to connect the dots. Holistic care isn’t just a buzzword—it’s better medicine.</p>",
