  "html": "<p>“Whole-person care” gets thrown around so often it’s easy to forget what it actually means. At Oasis, it’s not about trendy supplements or endless appointments—it’s about treating you as a complete human being, not a collection of symptoms.</p><p>Here’s what that looks like in practice:</p><ul><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Your providers—psychiatric, therapeutic, and medical—communicate to align treatment goals.</li><li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Your plan evolves as your needs change. No cookie-cutter care here.</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> You meet with your providers through secure telehealth, from home or wherever you feel comfortable.</li></ul><p>Healing doesn’t happen in isolation, and it doesn’t happen overnight. Whole-person care makes the process consistent and compassionate, helping you rebuild balance one step at a time.</p>",
